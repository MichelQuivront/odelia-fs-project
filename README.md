# Kanban — Full-Stack Course Project

OpenLiberty (Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile + MicroProfile 7.1) + Angular 20 + PostgreSQL.

**The board is secured with Keycloak and MicroProfile JWT, and every board
belongs to the person who created it.**

## Layout

```
backend/     Jakarta EE 11 Web Profile + MicroProfile 7.1 on OpenLiberty
frontend/    Angular 20 (standalone components, signals) + Angular CDK + keycloak-js
keycloak/    kanban-realm.json — imported by the Keycloak container at startup
docker-compose.yml
```

## Running

### With a Dev Container (recommended for the course)

Students only need **Docker + VS Code** (or nothing at all with GitHub
Codespaces). Open the folder and run *Dev Containers: Reopen in Container*.
This starts PostgreSQL and Keycloak and gives you a shell with Java 21, Maven
and Node 22 already installed — no local toolchain to set up.

```bash
# inside the container, two terminals:
cd backend  && mvn liberty:dev     # http://localhost:9080, hot reload
cd frontend && npm install && npm start   # http://localhost:4200
```

See `.devcontainer/` for the configuration.

### With Docker Compose directly

```bash
# 1. database + Keycloak + backend
docker compose up -d --build postgres keycloak backend

# 2. frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install      # first time only
npm start        # http://localhost:4200
```

Opening <http://localhost:4200> now redirects to Keycloak. Sign in as
`alice` / `alice` (see `keycloak/README.md` for the other accounts).

### Backend without Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres keycloak
cd backend
# Liberty runs on the host, so Keycloak is at localhost:8081, not keycloak:8080
export MP_JWT_VERIFY_PUBLICKEY_LOCATION=http://localhost:8081/realms/kanban/protocol/openid-connect/certs
mvn liberty:dev          # http://localhost:9080, hot reload
```

## Endpoints

Every `/api` endpoint requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with the `user`
or `admin` realm role — no token is a **401**, someone else's board is a **403**.

| Method | Path                     | Description                                   |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/boards`            | Own + shared boards by name (all, for admins) |
| POST   | `/api/boards`            | Create a board (+ "To do"/"Doing"/"Done")     |
| GET    | `/api/boards/{id}`       | One board                                     |

| POST   | `/api/boards/{id}/lists` | Add a column                                  |
| GET    | `/api/lists/{id}`        | One column                                    |
| PUT    | `/api/lists/{id}`        | Rename / move a column                        |
| DELETE | `/api/lists/{id}`        | Delete a column and its cards                 |
| GET    | `/api/lists/{id}/cards`  | Cards of a column, by position                |
| POST   | `/api/lists/{id}/cards`  | Add a card (appended to the end)              |
| GET    | `/api/cards/{id}`        | One card                                      |
| PUT    | `/api/cards/{id}`        | Edit a card's title / description             |
| DELETE | `/api/cards/{id}`        | Delete a card                                 |
| PATCH  | `/api/cards/{id}/move`   | Move a card: `{ "targetListId", "position" }` |
| GET    | `/api/boards/{id}/members`            | Members of a board (owner, members, admin)   |
| POST   | `/api/boards/{id}/members`            | Share: `{ "username": "bob" }` (owner/admin) |
| DELETE | `/api/boards/{id}/members/{username}` | Unshare (owner/admin)                        |
| GET    | `/api/me`                | The caller: `{ username, roles, admin }`      |

A board is visible to its owner, to its members, and to admins. Members can
work on columns and cards, but only the owner (or an admin) can rename or
delete the board and manage its members.

Also available and left open on purpose (ops endpoints, not user data):
`/health/ready` (MicroProfile Health, checks PostgreSQL), `/openapi` and
`/openapi/ui` (MicroProfile OpenAPI), `/metrics`.

### Trying it with curl

The realm enables the password grant so a token can be fetched without a browser.
Run these commands from your host machine (not the Dev Container's integrated terminal) —
Ask **localhost:8081** for it — a token minted at `keycloak:8080`
carries the wrong `iss` and the backend rejects it.

**bash / curl**

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8081/realms/kanban/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -d grant_type=password -d client_id=kanban-app \
  -d username=alice -d password=alice | jq -r .access_token)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:9080/api/boards
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/api/boards \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Sprint 1"}'

# add a card to a column, then move it to another column at position 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/api/lists/1/cards \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"title":"Write the README"}'
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:9080/api/cards/1/move \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"targetListId":2,"position":0}'

# without a token: 401
curl -i http://localhost:9080/api/boards

# what the backend sees in the token
echo "$TOKEN" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq '{iss, aud, preferred_username, groups}'
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
    -Uri http://localhost:8081/realms/kanban/protocol/openid-connect/token `
    -Body @{ grant_type = "password"; client_id = "kanban-app"; username = "alice"; password = "alice" }
$TOKEN = $resp.access_token

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:9080/api/boards -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:9080/api/boards `
    -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" } -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body '{"name":"Sprint 1"}'

# add a card to a column, then move it to another column at position 0
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:9080/api/lists/1/cards `
    -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" } -ContentType "application/json" `

    -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" } -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body '{"targetListId":2,"position":0}'

# without a token: 401
try { Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:9080/api/boards }
catch { $_.Exception.Response.StatusCode }

# what the backend sees in the token
$payload = $TOKEN.Split('.')[1].Replace('-', '+').Replace('_', '/')
$payload += '=' * ((4 - $payload.Length % 4) % 4)
[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($payload)) |
    ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object iss, aud, preferred_username, groups
```

## Notes on the stack

- **Jakarta Data 1.0** is new in Jakarta EE 11 and is part of the Web Profile,
  so `webProfile-11.0` alone is enough.
  The repositories (`BoardRepository`, `BoardListRepository`, `CardRepository`)
  are interfaces only — Liberty generates the implementation, derives the
  persistence unit from the `jdbc/kanban` data source, and creates the tables at
  startup.
- `BoardList` references its board by `boardId`, and `Card` references its column
  by `listId`, rather than by JPA associations: it keeps the repositories and the
  JSON flat.
- `Card.position` is a 0-based index within a column. `PATCH /api/cards/{id}/move`
  is the only endpoint that changes it: it renumbers the affected column(s) so
  positions stay contiguous. Deleting a card or column cascades in the resource
  layer (no `ON DELETE CASCADE`).
- CORS for `http://localhost:4200` is configured in `server.xml`, but the
  Angular dev server proxies `/api` to port 9080 (`frontend/proxy.conf.json`),
  so the browser stays single-origin. Keycloak is *not* proxied: the browser
  talks to `localhost:8081` directly, which is why the realm lists
  `http://localhost:4200` under `webOrigins`.
- **Security** — `@LoginConfig(authMethod = "MP-JWT")` on
  `KanbanApplication` puts the whole API behind bearer tokens; the issuer, the
  JWKS URL and the expected audience are plain MicroProfile Config properties in
  `microprofile-config.properties`, not Liberty-specific `server.xml` elements.
  `backend/.../security/` holds the two beans on top of that: `CurrentUser`
  (who is calling, are they an admin) and `BoardAccess` (does this board — or
  the board this column/card belongs to — belong to them).
- The backend reaches Keycloak at `keycloak:8080` while the browser reaches it
  at `localhost:8081`. The JWKS fetch uses the first, the `iss` claim in the
  token is the second: they are different URLs for the same server and both
  appear in `microprofile-config.properties`.
- On the Angular side, `src/app/auth/` mirrors the backend's `security/`
  package: `AuthService` (keycloak-js + signals), `authInterceptor` (adds the
  `Authorization` header and silently refreshes the token) and `authGuard`
  (redirects to the Keycloak login page). `BoardService` never mentions a token.
- Angular 20 is used; it requires Node >= 20.19 (or 22.12+). The Dev Container
  ships Node 22, so there is no host Node version to worry about.
